Hello World! welcome to my super secret development site.</br>
the way this site works is each project has a name and a number. (EG. AB12 would be the 12th version of project AB) number 0 is always reserved for the active development. (EG. AB0) sometimes the code for a particular version will be saved in a sub-directory called code (EG. AB12/code)</br>
